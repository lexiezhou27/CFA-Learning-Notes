# MODULE 1.1: INTEREST RATES AND RETURN MEASUREMENT

## LOS 1.a: Interpret interest rates as required rates of return, discount rates, or opportunity costs and explain an interest rate as the sum of a real risk-free rate and premiums that compensate investors for bearing distinct types of risk.

### 1. Interpretations of Interest Rates (利率的三种解读)
Interest rates measure the time value of money and can be interpreted in three ways:
* **Required Rate of Return (必要回报率):** The minimum return that investors and savers require to willingly lend their funds, given the risk.
* **Discount Rate (折现率):** The rate used to discount future payments to their equivalent present value.
* **Opportunity Cost (机会成本):** The return forgone when current consumption is chosen rather than saving (postponing consumption).

### 2. Components of Interest Rates (利率的组成要素)
A nominal interest rate consists of a real risk-free rate plus several risk premiums.

nominal rate of interest = real risk-free rate + inflation premium + default risk premium + liquidity premium + maturity premium



* **Real Risk-Free Rate (真实无风险利率):** A theoretical rate on a single-period loan with no expectation of inflation and zero probability of default. It represents **time preference** (the degree to which current consumption is preferred to future consumption).
* **Inflation Premium (通胀溢价):** Compensates investors for the expected loss of purchasing power over time.
    * *Note: $\text{Nominal risk-free rate} \approx \text{real risk-free rate} + \text{expected inflation rate}$ (e.g., U.S.
